The Task of Naming


To name the beast is not to indulge it, but to see it, to know its shape,
and by knowing, to begin transforming it.
This is repentance- not shame, but re-integration.
It is the movement from fragmentation to wholeness. From exile to return.
Christ does not destroy the beast. He tames it.
Binds it to love.
Redeems even the depths.


The Pattern Reclaimed


In the spiral of return,
the shadow must be passed through. No resurrection without death.
No crown without cross.

No Eden without the naming of the beast. The sacred cosmos demands it.
Not to punish- but to complete the pattern.
To become like Christ is to pass through Gethsemane. To face the night.
To see the beast and not flinch. To speak its name and still say, "Nevertheless, Thy will be done." To master the beast is not to kill it,
but to recognize it as part of you, and bring it home.

Chapter 35: The Altar and the Axis - Sacrifice as Sacred Geometry

"In the center of the garden was the Tree of Life, and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil." -Genesis 2:9


The Pattern of the Sacred


In nearly every ancient world tradition, a central place exists- a mountain, a tree, a temple, an altar.
This axis mundi, or "world axis,"
connects heaven and earth, time and eternity, matter and spirit. It is the point of contact, the place of exchange.
In the biblical story, this axis takes form in Eden as the Tree of Life- and later, in Abraham's day, as an altar.

Sacrifice: The Geometry of Return


What is sacrifice?
In a symbolic cosmos, sacrifice is not arbitrary loss. It is the offering of what is most valuable,
placed at the center, in trust that it will be received and returned,

transformed.


This is the sacred geometry:
  The best of the flock.
  The first of the harvest.
  The beating heart.


To sacrifice is to align the self with the structure of reality- to recognize that life flows through the giving.

The Cain and Abel Pattern


Cain and Abel both offer sacrifices. But only Abel's is "accepted." Why?
Not because of favoritism.
But because the geometry is off.
Abel's gift is his best, his first.
Cain's is partial-it reflects the fragmented self.
In this moment, Cain's altar is crooked.
The axis is broken. The pattern is violated.

The result?
Rejection, jealousy, violence.
Cain's rage is the mark of dis-integration. And yet-God still speaks to him.
 "If you do well, will you not be accepted?" There is always a way back to the center.

Christ and the Final Altar


Christ is the perfect axis-
the bridge between heaven and earth. His cross is not only a form of execution. It is the ultimate altar,
the Tree of Life reappearing in the center of the world. On it, He becomes both priest and offering.
The sacrifice is not slain by men alone- but given freely by the Logos.

This fulfills the pattern:
the center restored, the axis reset, the geometry made whole.

Sacred Self, Sacred Offering


You are also an altar. You are also a center. Each choice is a sacrifice.
Each act of love, truth, mercy-
an offering placed on the world's sacred axis.
When rightly aligned, your life becomes a holy place. A microcosm of Eden.
A fractal of the Cross.


"Present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God-this is your spiritual
worship." -Romans 12:1

Chapter 36: The Language of the Heavens -
Stars, Seasons, and the Sacred Pattern

"The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands." -Psalm 19:1


The Cosmic Clock


Before we had clocks, calendars, or compasses, human beings looked up.
The sky was our first textbook. The stars our first scripture.
Patterns in the heavens-
the rising and setting of the sun,
the moon's cycles,
the constellations circling the pole- these rhythms taught us to plant,
to harvest, to pray. In ancient minds,
to observe the heavens was to listen to the divine.


Sacred Astronomy


There is a deep symbolic language encoded in the heavens.


In nearly every culture:
  The sun is a symbol of light, life, and kingship.
  The moon of cycles, time, and hidden wisdom.
  The stars: order, multiplicity, navigation.


The zodiac-far from modern misuse- was once a sacred calendar,
marking the dance of the year and mirroring the journey of the soul. Each season was not just a time-
but a state of being, a spiritual phase in the soul's unfolding.


God's First Revelation


Genesis tells us God created the lights
"for signs and seasons."
This does not simply mean agricultural timekeeping.
The Hebrew word for "signs" is othoth-
the same word used for covenants and prophetic markers. Thus the sky becomes covenantal,

a visual contract between Creator and creation. The heavens are not just beautiful-
they are structured with intention, embedded with wisdom.


Christ and the Cosmos


Even Christ's life unfolds under the stars:


  A star rises in the east, leading wise men to His cradle.
  He is crucified under a darkened sky.
  His return is prophesied with cosmic signs.


The heavens respond to Him because they were made through Him. He is the Logos of the Cosmos,
and in His body, the rhythms of time and space converge.


You in the Pattern


You are not separate from this grand celestial design. Your breath aligns with the turning of the earth.
Your heart beats in rhythm with the tides. To live symbolically is to recognize this:

that your life is not random, but woven into the divine fabric of creation. The sky still speaks.
We need only learn to read.


"He determines the number of the stars; he calls them each by name." -Psalm 147:4

Chapter 37: Language, Naming, and the Architect of Meaning

"Out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them. And whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name." -Genesis 2:19




The Power of Naming


To name something is not merely to label it- it is to recognize its essence.
In Eden, Adam's first act as image-bearer was to give names to creation. This was not control,
but participation in the divine act of creation itself. God formed.
Adam discerned.
And through language, the world took shape.


Logos and Language


The Logos is not only the divine order-

it is also the principle of intelligibility. To speak is to manifest the Logos.
To name rightly is to participate in divine wisdom. To misuse language is to corrupt perception.
Thus, every lie, every deception, is not just morally wrong- it is cosmically dissonant,
disrupting the harmony between word and world.


The Fall and the Fracture of Language


After the fall, the human relationship to language changed.


  Words became tools of manipulation.
  Truth was separated from speech.
  Babel marked the fracturing of unified meaning.


In Babel, language multiplied-
not as blessing, but as a sign of disunity.
Only in Christ, the true Word, can Babel be reversed. At Pentecost, many tongues become one message again.

Symbol as Reunifier


 Symbolic language is the bridge between the visible and the invisible. Where literalism limits, symbol opens. Where science dissects, symbol reunifies.
To live symbolically is to walk as Adam once did:
perceiving the world not only as material, but as meaningful. The world is not inert.
It is enchanted- a living scroll of divine meaning.
