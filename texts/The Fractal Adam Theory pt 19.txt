Notes on Interpretation
* Each column reflects a fractal phase of the soul's cosmic journey: forgetting,
remembering, returning.
* The Christic Axis Equivalent identifies the expression of the Logos (the central divine pattern) within that tradition-not always named "Christ," but pointing to the same ontological reality.

* These spirals differ in language and metaphysics, but not in direction. They spiral toward the same divine remembrance.
